A modern version of `Seven Icelandic Short Stories`
===================================================

In 1960 the Icelandic Ministry of Education published a book titled
`Seven Icelandic Short Stories`. The book was the fourth in a series of
books funded by the Council of Europe that aimed to 'make literature
written in the less known European languages available to a wider
public'.

This is my attempt to continue that aim on this information superhighway
of ours. I aim to bring the seven short stories to a wider audience by
releasing them on the Web. The `book is available from Project Gutenberg`_
but I want to improve on that by:

* correcting the errors in the text;
* adding semantic markup to the plain-text version of the book;
* automating the publishing of the book in HTML, ePub, and PDF; and
* publishing a free HTML version of the book on the Web in a form that's
  a pleasure to read.

Having bought a first edition hardback copy of the book I'm reading it
in tandem with the plain-text Gutenberg copy in tandem, correcting
errors and adding `reStructuredText`_ markup as I go. Once that's done
I'll use `Pandoc`_ to create the various versions and host them on
`GitHub Pages`_.
